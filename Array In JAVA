*** 
      sometimes we need to know the length of any array what is dynamically initialized 
                                                                                         ***
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
    public class ArrayInJava {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
 
           int[] number = {1,23,34,5,4,3,2,2,323};
           
           System.out.println("the length of this array is : " + number.length);
  
    }
}         






        *** the                 number.length        extention is help us to find the length of any array ***
        
        
        we can also initialized the array with an object , becouse we know that an array is an object of dynamically
        generated class -----------
        
        
        
        public class PatternNumber {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
 
       ***    int[] number = new int[5]; ***
    
           System.out.println("the length of this array is : " + number.length);
  
    }
}
